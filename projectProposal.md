# Mobile Robotics Computer Vision Project Proposal

Cypress Frankenfeld, Halie Murray-Davis

## What is the main idea?

We will create a neural network that learns how to follow a path marked on the ground with tape by using computer vision and the front-facing camera. 

----

## What topics will we explore and what will we generate?  What is our MVP?  What is a stretch goal?

Our MVP is to have our robot follow a black line over 4 inches wide. The line will be straight and 5 feet long. The lighting will be controlled and we will use whatever lighting makes it easiest for us to get the robot moving, most likely diffuse light that evenly illuminates the scene.

Our reach goal is to have our robot follow any path which has color variation with its surrounding terrain. The shape of this path can be arbitrary. 

A realistic goal is for the robot to follow a winding path in controlled lighting. If we are really good, we might get it working in not controlled lighting.

## Our learning goals

**Both**
Learn how neural networks work (while using a premade python neural network package).
Learn how to use OpenCV
Make a project that looks cool/awesome

**Cypress**
Learn more about ROS in general.

**Halie**
Become comfortable with computer vision
Become comfortable using and deploying AI to solve robotic problems


## Timeline

| Week: | Deliverables |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 10/21 | Project Proposal |
| 10/24 | Have Open CV and SciKitLearn* installed and happy |
| 10/28 | Be able to make sense of a path in an image, Have started writing code for the Neural Network |
| 10/31 | Have some element of Neural Network working |
| 11/4  | Integration between Neural Network and Image Paths started |
| 11/7  | Final presentation, Write Up |


## Frameworks and algorithms we are planning to use

* Neural network
* Color differential across an image to identify contrasting features (paths)
* Weâ€™re not sure what specific algorithms we will use, but we will talk to Paul and search the internet/Stack Overflow.

## Potential risks

* Setting goals too high, or spending too much time on things that we could black-box.
* Code bloat (size) making it hard to debug.
* Not starting on the Neural Network early enough to get it fully working before the deadline

## Help we might need from The Paul

Assistance learning about neural networks and computer vision. One-on-one sessions in class or after hours would be useful.

Help implementing and guiding us with the neural network.

Black Tape. For marking our path. : )
